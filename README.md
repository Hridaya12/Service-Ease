'Service Ease' is a Python Django-based web platform designed to streamline electrician
and plumber hiring procedures. The principal aims of the project are to develop a userfriendly interface for selecting service providers that includes comprehensive profiles,
ratings, and reviews, so enabling clients to make well-informed decisions. The platform
incorporates a map function and user location selection, allowing users to designate their
location for service providers to easily access. An automatic credit point system has been
put in place to improve user credibility. The establishment of a transparent and safe
payment system that accepts a variety of payment ways is another major goal of the
project. Users are able to assess service providers through a strong rating system, which
adds to the platform's overall reputation. When it comes to hiring electricians and
plumbers, Service Ease stands out as a holistic solution that takes care of important
aspects of user engagement, credibility, and service quality. With its promise of
effectiveness, openness, and dependability, the project offers a user-centric platform that
improves the overall experience for both clients and service providers
